# Database Schema Migration: Function Parameter Standardization

## Summary
This PR implements Phase 1 of our database schema standardization plan, focusing on the critical issue of function parameter standardization. It resolves the parameter mismatch between client code and database functions that was causing errors in the ticket reservation system.

## Changes
- **Client Code Update**: Changed parameter name in `reservationService.ts` from `p_ticket_type_id` to `p_ticket_definition_id`
- **Database Migration**: Created migration script to standardize function parameters
- **System Improvements**: Added automated cleanup of expired reservations and performance indexes
- **Deployment Tools**: Created deployment script and verification queries

## Why
The ticket reservation system was failing because the client code was using `p_ticket_type_id` but the database expected `p_ticket_definition_id`. This standardization ensures consistent naming throughout the system and removes the source of bugs.

## Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Tested the changes in development environment
- **Verification Queries**: Created comprehensive verification queries to validate migration success
- **Backup Mechanism**: Added backup creation before migration for safety

## What's Next (Phase 2)
- Table name standardization (lowercase to PascalCase)
- Column name standardization (snake_case to camelCase)
- Complete transition to the new schema model

## Deployment Instructions
1. Run the deployment script: `.documentation/database/deployment-script.sh`
2. Verify migration success with verification queries
3. Monitor application for 24-48 hours after deployment

## Rollback Plan
If issues are detected, roll back using:
1. Restore from the backup created during deployment
2. Revert client code changes
