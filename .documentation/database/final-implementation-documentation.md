# LodgeTix Database Schema Migration: Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document serves as the final implementation documentation for the LodgeTix database schema migration project. The project was designed to address several schema inconsistencies including duplicate tables, inconsistent naming conventions, and parameter mismatches. The implementation was completed in four well-defined phases, each addressing specific aspects of the database standardization.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Function Parameter Standardization

#### Objective
Resolve the critical issue of parameter name mismatch between client code and database functions that was causing errors in the ticket reservation system.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Client Code Update**:
   - Updated `src/lib/reservationService.ts` to use `p_ticket_definition_id` instead of `p_ticket_type_id`.

2. **Database Function Update**:
   - Created migration script `20250505000000_implement_schema_standardization.sql`.
   - Standardized function parameters across all ticket-related functions.
   - Added safety backups for easy rollback.

3. **System Improvements**:
   - Added automated cleanup of expired ticket reservations.
   - Added performance optimization indexes.
   - Improved error handling and validation.

### Phase 2: Table Name Standardization

#### Objective
Standardize all table names to use consistent PascalCase naming convention.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Migration Script**:
   - Created `20250506000000_standardize_table_names.sql`.
   - Systematically renamed all tables from snake_case to PascalCase.
   - Updated views, triggers, and indexes to reference new table names.

2. **Client Code Update**:
   - Updated all table references in API service files.
   - Modified Supabase queries using `.from()` to reference standardized table names.

3. **Database Function Updates**:
   - Updated all database functions to use standardized table names.

### Phase 3: Column Name Standardization

#### Objective
Standardize all column names to use consistent camelCase naming convention.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Migration Script**:
   - Created `20250507000000_standardize_column_names.sql`.
   - Renamed all columns from snake_case to camelCase.
   - Updated constraints, indexes, and functions to use new column names.

2. **Client Code Update**:
   - Updated all column references in API service files.
   - Modified database queries to use standardized column names.
   - Updated interface definitions to match new column naming.

### Phase 4: Schema Consolidation

#### Objective
Consolidate duplicate tables and ensure data integrity across the schema.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Migration Script**:
   - Created `20250508000000_schema_consolidation.sql`.
   - Implemented logic to consolidate duplicate `registrations` and `Registrations` tables.
   - Added data integrity verification with comprehensive checks.

2. **Administrative Views**:
   - Created `DatabaseSchemaStatus` view for administrators to monitor the schema.
   - Created `SchemaRelationships` view to document table relationships.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Implemented referential integrity checks.
   - Created safety backups before consolidation.

## Migration Scripts

The following migration scripts were created to implement the schema changes:

1. `20250505000000_implement_schema_standardization.sql` (Phase 1)
2. `20250506000000_standardize_table_names.sql` (Phase 2)
3. `20250507000000_standardize_column_names.sql` (Phase 3)
4. `20250508000000_schema_consolidation.sql` (Phase 4)

Additionally, a comprehensive verification script was created to validate the success of the migration:

- `verification/verify_migration_success.sql`

## Client Code Updates

The following client files were updated to ensure compatibility with the standardized schema:

1. API Service Files:
   - `src/lib/api/events.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/registrations.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/customers.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/lodges.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/masons.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/guests.ts`
   - `src/lib/api/grandLodges.ts`

2. Core Service Files:
   - `src/lib/reservationService.ts`

3. Serverless Functions:
   - `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

## Standardized Naming Conventions

The migration established consistent naming conventions across the schema:

1. **Tables**: PascalCase (e.g., `Events`, `Tickets`, `Registrations`)
2. **Columns**: camelCase (e.g., `eventId`, `ticketId`, `parentEventId`)
3. **Function Parameters**: snake_case with p_ prefix (e.g., `p_event_id`, `p_ticket_definition_id`)
4. **Constraints & Indexes**: Descriptive snake_case (e.g., `idx_tickets_availability`)

## Database Structure

The standardized database includes the following key tables and relationships:

### Event Management Domain
- `Events`: Core event information
- `EventDays`: Information about specific days for multi-day events
- `TicketDefinitions`: Defines available ticket types
- `Packages`: Bundles of events offered as a package
- `PackageEvents`: Junction table for packages and events

### Contact and Organization Domain
- `Contacts`: Core contact information
- `MasonicProfiles`: Masonic-specific information
- `Organisations`: Information about lodges and grand lodges
- `OrganisationMemberships`: Memberships in organizations

### Registration and Ticketing Domain
- `Customers`: Customer billing information
- `Registrations`: Event registration information
- `Attendees`: Information about people attending events
- `Tickets`: Individual tickets for events

### Value-Added Services Domain
- `ValueAddedServices`: Additional services offered
- `EventVasOptions`: VAS options for specific events
- `PackageVasOptions`: VAS options for packages
- `RegistrationVas`: VAS items chosen for a registration

## Verification and Validation

The migration included comprehensive verification to ensure success:

1. **Function Parameter Standardization Checks**:
   - Verified all functions use standardized parameter names.
   - Tested client code compatibility.

2. **Table Name Standardization Checks**:
   - Verified all tables follow PascalCase naming.
   - Checked for critical table existence.

3. **Column Name Standardization Checks**:
   - Verified all columns follow camelCase naming.
   - Validated specific column name changes.

4. **Schema Consolidation Checks**:
   - Verified no duplicate tables exist.
   - Validated foreign key relationships.
   - Checked data integrity across related tables.

## Performance Optimizations

The migration included several performance optimizations:

1. **Optimized Indexes**:
   - Created specialized indexes for ticket operations.
   - Added index for ticket reservation status.
   - Added index for expired reservation cleanup.

2. **Automated Maintenance**:
   - Implemented scheduled job to clear expired reservations.
   - Added automated timestamp updates.

3. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Improved transaction handling for ticket reservations.
   - Added proper locking with SKIP LOCKED for concurrent operations.

## Deployment Recommendations

For deploying this migration to production:

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - Create comprehensive database backup.
   - Schedule maintenance window during low-traffic period.
   - Test migration in staging environment.

2. **Deployment Order**:
   - Deploy client code changes first to ensure compatibility.
   - Apply migrations in numerical order.
   - Run verification script immediately after each phase.

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Monitor application logs for 24-48 hours.
   - Verify all critical workflows function correctly.
   - Keep backup schema for at least 7 days.

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues during deployment:

1. **Phase-Specific Rollback**:
   - Each migration includes backup mechanisms.
   - Create point-in-time backups before each phase.

2. **Full Rollback**:
   - Restore from pre-migration backup.
   - Revert client code changes.

## Conclusion

The database schema migration has successfully addressed all the identified issues:

1. ✅ Standardized function parameters to fix ticket reservation errors.
2. ✅ Standardized table names for consistent PascalCase naming.
3. ✅ Standardized column names for consistent camelCase naming.
4. ✅ Consolidated duplicate tables and ensured data integrity.

The schema is now consistent, maintainable, and follows best practices for modern database design. The comprehensive documentation and verification mechanisms ensure the system can be maintained and extended with confidence.
