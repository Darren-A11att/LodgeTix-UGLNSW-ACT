# Step 13: User Account Creation and Management

## Context for the Agentic AI Software Engineer
After implementing conditional authentication during the registration process, we need to complete the user account creation and management functionality. While users can register for events without creating an account, we want to provide comprehensive account management features for those who do authenticate or create accounts. This includes profile management, viewing registration history, and managing preferences. Currently, the LodgeTix application has limited account management features using mock data, and we need to integrate this with Supabase.

## Objective
Implement user account creation and management functionality that allows users to create accounts, manage their profiles, view their registration history, and update their preferences. This will provide a complete user experience for authenticated users and encourage more users to create accounts for easier future registrations.

## Pre-requisites
- Supabase client is properly configured (Step 1)
- TypeScript interfaces are updated to match the database schema (Step 2)
- Events integration is complete (Steps 3-5)
- Registration flows are implemented (Steps 6-11)
- Conditional authentication is implemented (Step 12)
- Understanding of Supabase authentication and user management

## Analysis Steps

1. Examine the current account-related components:
   - Review any existing account management pages or components
   - Understand how user profiles are currently displayed and edited
   - Identify what account management features are needed
   - Note how the application currently handles account creation

2. Analyze the Supabase user authentication system:
   - Understand the full capabilities of Supabase auth
   - Review methods for user registration, password reset, and email verification
   - Note how user metadata is stored and managed
   - Examine how to securely update user information

3. Review the users and related tables:
   - Examine the public.users table structure and its relationship to auth.users
   - Note how user profiles are related to other data (registrations, preferences)
   - Understand how to query for user-specific data
   - Identify how to handle user deletion or account deactivation

4. Understand the user management workflow:
   - Map out the account creation process
   - Identify flows for password reset and email verification
   - Note how users would update their profiles
   - Understand how users would view their registration history

## Implementation Steps

1. Create TypeScript interfaces for user account management:
   - Define interfaces that represent user account data
   - Create types for account management forms and responses
   - Define interfaces for user preferences and settings
   - Ensure proper typing for all user-related operations

2. Implement user registration functionality:
   - Create or update the signup form component
   - Implement proper validation for registration fields
   - Add Supabase authentication integration
   - Implement email verification if required
   - Add proper error handling and success messages

3. Create password management functionality:
   - Implement password reset request form
   - Create password update component
   - Add validation for password strength and confirmation
   - Integrate with Supabase auth password functions
   - Ensure proper security measures and user feedback

4. Implement profile management:
   - Create a user profile page component
   - Implement forms for updating personal information
   - Add functionality to update Masonic details if applicable
   - Integrate with Supabase to save profile changes
   - Add validation and error handling

5. Create registration history functionality:
   - Implement a component to display past registrations
   - Create queries to fetch user-specific registration data
   - Add filtering and sorting options for registrations
   - Create detailed views for specific registrations
   - Ensure proper data formatting and display

6. Implement user preferences:
   - Create a preferences management component
   - Add options for notification preferences
   - Implement settings for privacy options
   - Create functionality to save preference changes
   - Ensure preferences are respected throughout the application

7. Add account security features:
   - Implement session management
   - Add options for changing email address
   - Create functionality for account deactivation
   - Add two-factor authentication if needed
   - Ensure proper security measures throughout

## Testing Steps

1. Test user registration:
   - Create a new account with valid information
   - Verify that the account is created in Supabase
   - Test email verification flow if implemented
   - Check that proper success messages are displayed
   - Verify that the user can log in with the new account

2. Test password management:
   - Request a password reset for an existing account
   - Verify that the reset email is sent
   - Test the password reset process
   - Change a password while logged in
   - Verify that old passwords no longer work

3. Test profile management:
   - Update various profile fields
   - Verify that changes are saved to the database
   - Test validation for required fields
   - Check that profile updates are immediately reflected
   - Verify that updates maintain relationships with other data

4. Test registration history:
   - View registration history for an account with past registrations
   - Verify that all expected registrations appear
   - Test filtering and sorting options
   - View details for a specific registration
   - Check that registration data is accurately displayed

5. Test user preferences:
   - Update various preference settings
   - Verify that changes are saved to the database
   - Check that preferences are respected in the application
   - Test notification settings if implemented
   - Verify that preferences persist across sessions

6. Test security features:
   - Verify session expiration behaves correctly
   - Test changing the account email address
   - Check account deactivation functionality
   - Test any implemented two-factor authentication
   - Verify protection against unauthorized access

## Verification Checklist

Before considering this step complete, verify that:

- [ ] Users can successfully create new accounts
- [ ] Email verification works as expected (if implemented)
- [ ] Users can reset forgotten passwords
- [ ] Users can update their passwords while logged in
- [ ] Profile information can be viewed and updated
- [ ] Masonic details can be managed for applicable users
- [ ] Registration history is accurately displayed
- [ ] User preferences are saved and applied correctly
- [ ] Account security features work as expected
- [ ] Form validation properly identifies and reports invalid inputs
- [ ] Success and error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Loading states appear during database operations
- [ ] The UI is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- [ ] No unauthorized access to user data is possible

## Common Errors and Solutions

1. If user registration fails:
   - Check that the Supabase auth configuration is correct
   - Verify that email domains are not restricted if using allowlists
   - Ensure that password requirements are clearly communicated
   - Test with a fresh email address to rule out conflicts

2. If password management doesn't work:
   - Verify that the reset email template is configured in Supabase
   - Check that the reset link format is correct
   - Ensure that password validation is consistent
   - Test with known good email addresses

3. If profile updates fail:
   - Check that the user has permission to update their profile
   - Verify that the update query is formatted correctly
   - Ensure that any unique constraints are respected
   - Test with minimal changes to isolate issues

4. If registration history doesn't display:
   - Check that queries filter correctly by user ID
   - Verify that the registration records exist in the database
   - Ensure that joins across tables work correctly
   - Test with accounts known to have registrations

5. If user preferences don't save:
   - Verify the preferences table structure
   - Check that updates are committed to the database
   - Ensure that preferences are loaded at the right time
   - Test with simple preference changes first

6. If security features fail:
   - Check Supabase auth configuration for session duration
   - Verify that RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
   - Ensure that sensitive operations require re-authentication
   - Test with multiple browsers or devices to verify session handling

Remember to implement features incrementally and test thoroughly at each step. Start with core account functions (registration, login), then add profile management, then registration history, and finally preferences and security features.
