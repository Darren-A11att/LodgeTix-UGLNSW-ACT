# Step 15: Create Registration Implementation

## Context for the Agentic AI Software Engineer
Now that we have implemented all attendee types, authentication, and ticket definitions, we need to implement the final step of creating a complete registration in the database. This involves gathering all the information collected during the registration process, creating the necessary records in the registrations table, and establishing relationships with attendees and tickets. This step ties together all the previous functionality and completes the registration flow.

## Objective
Implement the registration creation functionality to save complete registration data to the Supabase database, including all attendees, ticket selections, and related information. This will allow users to complete the registration process and transition to payment or confirmation.

## Pre-requisites
- Supabase client is properly configured (Step 1)
- TypeScript interfaces are updated to match the database schema (Step 2)
- Events integration is complete (Steps 3-5)
- Registration type selection is implemented (Step 6)
- All attendee types are implemented (Steps 7-11)
- Authentication functionality is implemented (Steps 12-13)
- Ticket definitions are implemented (Step 14)
- Understanding of the registrations and related tables in Supabase

## Analysis Steps

1. Examine the current registration submission process:
   - Analyze how the registration form is submitted in the current implementation
   - Identify where registration finalization occurs in the flow
   - Review how the form state is prepared for submission
   - Note any validation that happens before submission

2. Analyze the Supabase database structure for registrations:
   - Review the `registrations` table schema
   - Understand the relationships with users (`userid`), events (`eventid`), and organizations (`organizationid`)
   - Note fields like `registrationtype`, `status`, and `totalamount`
   - Identify related tables like `registration_tickets` and `registration_services`

3. Review the ticket assignment structure:
   - Understand how tickets are assigned to specific attendees
   - Analyze the `registration_tickets` table that links registrations and tickets
   - Note any quantity or pricing fields that need to be populated
   - Identify how these assignments relate to the selected tickets in the form

4. Understand the transaction requirements:
   - Determine if all database operations need to be performed as a transaction
   - Identify potential failure points in the registration creation process
   - Plan for data consistency in case of partial failures
   - Understand how to handle registration status transitions

## Implementation Steps

1. Create TypeScript interfaces for registration data:
   - Create or update `/src/shared/types/registration.ts`
   - Define interfaces that match the Supabase registrations table
   - Include interfaces for registration tickets and services
   - Create a comprehensive type for the complete registration submission
   - Ensure proper typing for all fields including optional ones

2. Implement API functions for registration creation:
   - Create a file at `/src/lib/api/registrations.ts` (if not already created)
   - Implement a `createRegistration` function that:
     - Takes the complete form state as input
     - Creates a record in the registrations table
     - Returns the created registration data
   - Add a `createRegistrationTickets` function that:
     - Takes a registration ID and ticket selections
     - Creates records in the registration_tickets table
     - Establishes relationships between registrations and tickets
   - Implement functions to handle attendee linking
   - Add proper error handling and typing
   - Consider using Supabase transactions if available

3. Update the registration submission process:
   - Modify the relevant component (likely in `PaymentSection.tsx` or similar)
   - Implement a comprehensive submission function that:
     - Validates the complete form state
     - Calls the registration creation API
     - Creates ticket assignments
     - Links all attendees to the registration
     - Updates registration status
   - Add loading states during submission
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery

4. Implement registration validation:
   - Create a validation function that checks all required fields
   - Verify that all attendees have assigned tickets
   - Validate that pricing information is correct
   - Ensure all required relationships can be established
   - Add clear error reporting for validation failures

5. Create a registration summary for confirmation:
   - Update the confirmation step to display registration details
   - Show all attendees and their assigned tickets
   - Display pricing information and total
   - Include event details and important information
   - Add options for managing the registration (if applicable)

6. Implement registration status management:
   - Add logic to handle different registration statuses
   - Implement status transitions based on payment completion
   - Add UI indicators for registration status
   - Consider email notifications for status changes
   - Implement registration reference numbers or identifiers

## Testing Steps

1. Test basic registration creation:
   - Complete a registration with minimal information
   - Verify a record is created in the registrations table
   - Check that the status is set correctly (likely "pending")
   - Verify the relationship with the selected event
   - Check that user ID is linked if authenticated

2. Test complete registration with all attendee types:
   - Create a registration with Masons, Mason partners, guests, and guest partners
   - Verify all attendees are properly linked to the registration
   - Check that relationships between attendees are maintained
   - Verify that all necessary data is saved for each attendee type
   - Test with different combinations of attendees

3. Test ticket assignment:
   - Complete a registration with different ticket selections
   - Verify records are created in the registration_tickets table
   - Check that quantities and prices are correctly recorded
   - Test uniform ticketing and individual ticket assignments
   - Verify total amount calculations

4. Test validation and error handling:
   - Try submitting incomplete registrations
   - Test with missing attendee information
   - Verify validation for ticket assignments
   - Check error messaging for various failure scenarios
   - Test recovery from submission failures

5. Test registration confirmation:
   - Complete a successful registration
   - Verify the confirmation page displays correct information
   - Check that all attendees and tickets are listed
   - Verify pricing information is accurately displayed
   - Test any post-registration options or links

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to the next step, verify that:

- [ ] Registrations are correctly created in the Supabase database
- [ ] All attendees are properly linked to the registration
- [ ] Ticket selections are saved in the registration_tickets table
- [ ] Registration type, status, and amount are correctly set
- [ ] User ID is linked for authenticated users
- [ ] Validation prevents submission of incomplete registrations
- [ ] Loading states appear during submission
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for submission failures
- [ ] The confirmation page displays complete registration information
- [ ] Registration reference numbers or identifiers are generated
- [ ] All relationships between tables are correctly established

## Common Errors and Solutions

1. If registration creation fails:
   - Check that the Supabase client is properly initialized
   - Verify that required fields are provided in the submission
   - Ensure RLS policies allow creation of registration records
   - Test with explicit values to verify the basic insertion works

2. If attendee linking fails:
   - Check that attendee records are created before linking
   - Verify that foreign key constraints are properly handled
   - Ensure all required relationships are established
   - Test with specific known IDs to verify relationships

3. If ticket assignments don't work:
   - Verify that the registration_tickets table is correctly structured
   - Check that ticket IDs and registration IDs are valid
   - Ensure the quantity and price fields are properly calculated
   - Test with explicit ticket assignments to verify functionality

4. If validation doesn't catch issues:
   - Review the validation logic for all required fields
   - Check for edge cases with different attendee combinations
   - Verify that ticket assignment validation is comprehensive
   - Test with intentionally invalid data to ensure validation works

5. If the confirmation page doesn't display correctly:
   - Check that all registration data is passed to the confirmation component
   - Verify that attendee and ticket information is properly formatted
   - Ensure pricing calculations are correct in the display
   - Test with different registration sizes to verify formatting

Remember to implement features incrementally and test thoroughly at each step. Start with basic registration creation, then add attendee linking, then ticket assignments, and finally the confirmation display.
